# Polynomial Machine Learning

This program runs a simulation of polynomial regression and plots the appropriate information to a graph using matplotlib.
The data used is on the price of Coca-Cola bottles per size (not factual data).

The use of training datasets and testing datasets allow for the model to use linear regression and polynomial features mean that a graph presented is in the shape of a parabola,
representing the curviture as well as a line of best fit, meaning the model is more accurate, showing both the ways to predict price per bottle size.

This machine learning is basic but implements key functions and logic to predict answers, which acts as an introduction to machine learning.
